          <h5>About TFN Properties</h5>
          <span>Is TFN Properties an Estate Agent?</span>
          <span>
            We are not estate agents but we aim to be the place for property seekers to find details
            of all properties available to buy, rent, manage and home improvement.
          </span>
          <h5>The Site</h5>
          <span>Why don't all the properties have full details and photos?</span>
          <span>
            While TFN Properties encourages all our agents to provide us full property details with
            as much information as possible, not all agents are able and some choose not to comply.
            Sometimes, an agent might want to post a newly available property before s/he has had an
            opportunity to take photographs or prepare a full description. If you want more
            information on a property you have seen on TFN Properties, we recommend that you contact
            the agent directly.

          <span>Which internet browsers or mobile phones do we support?</span>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>Internet Explorer 8 or above (download: Windows)</li>
            <li>Safari 5 or above (download: Windows Mac)</li>

            More Information About Properties What should I do if I want more information about one
            of the properties?
          </span>
          <span>
            TFN Properties is not itself an Estate Agent. We only display the properties provided to
            us. We recommend that you contact the estate agent or developer who is marketing the
            property if you require further information. The agent's contact details are on the
            property details page. You can call the phone number provided or use the "Request
            details" button on the property details page to email the agent with your questions.

          <span>
            We're sorry that the agent or developer you contacted has not promptly replied to your
            request. We are constantly working with our members to insure that they quickly respond
            to queries. The best way to make sure your queries are answered immediately is by
            calling the agent directly.

          <span>How is TFN Properties different from others?</span>
          <span>We are different in a number of ways as follows:</span>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>Fast-growing, unique audience providing both buyer and vendor leads</li>
            <li>Carefully designed property website to maximize the property listing online</li>
          </ol>
          <span>How do you get traffic to your website?</span>
          <span>
            We have a highly experienced digital marketing team which allows us to market ourselves
            very efficiently. How do I know when I receive a lead? All leads will be sent directly
            via email to the contact email you provide at the time of registering and which you may
            amend at any time. How do I upload our listings? You can upload your listing by signing
            up as an agent and adding your property via the “My Adverts” section of the website. Is
            there any limit to the number of properties I can list? No, you may market as many for
            sale/to rent listings as you like. Is there a limit to the number of photographs I can
            upload? No, you may upload as many photographs as you like for each property.
